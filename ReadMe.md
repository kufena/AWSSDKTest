#Playing with AWS SDK#

This is a little project for playing with various aspects of the AWS SDK.

First of all AWSSDKTest plays with S3 and lists some things in a bucket, and then uses Polly to create a file of someone saying "Hello my lovely little world."
It works but the NetCoreAudio package doesn't say anything.
